**This is a report about the development phase.**

This phase was very hard. We need to developp the whole application in less than 1 week it was very short. At the beginning we set 3 differents use cases per person. But we saw that to developp every part of the application we need to develop certain uses cases first. With the lack of time, we need to forgot some fonctionnality like the doctor policy or the answer request.

But the application is working and we developp the principal fonctionnality of the application : make an appointment.

During the development phase we need to redesign some methods to adapt to our code.
