## Introduction

During this semester, we had to realize a java project. We chose to work on an application for doctors and patients so that patients can make appointments easily with doctors. I was in a team composed of 4 members. Nick Zambrano, Bastien Ricoeur and Yoann Masson and this is a complete overview of how I felt during this project.

## The beggining

We first started to think about how we could organize ourselves without really knowing precisely all the phases that we will go through. We all got responsabilities. I was then in charge of Design, Graphical design and Tools. The first phase I had to think of was discussing with all the members of my groups for preferences and past experience of tools they used and that could fit in this kind of project. I then took the responsability to create a Google Drive, Github repository, Trello, Slack chat, ... This was an easy phase as I just went through a big project before and I was in charge of 10 persons in a 40 persons work-force.
    I wasn't really worried by this project at this time because I though we would be able to manage it easily. But things didn't go how I expected.

## The hard part

First of all, we had to write really precise use-cases which we never did before. It wasn't really a hard task but a bit time consuming. We all learnt how use-cases should be developed. We had 4/5 weeks for this phase. Then we started the design phase and there we had only 1 week. The design phase is the most important phase and as the responsible of this, I had to make sure everyone understand clearly what we had to do and how we would do it. I got a bit tensed because we had so little time and we had so many diagrams to make for each use-case. The good point of this is that we learnt the hard way how to design an application. The hard way but the right way. We learnt how to make some diagrams. But this part was consuming a huge ammount of time. One week was way too fast to realize all this work and even if it's a milestone. This was still a scholar project and we had to develiver something on time. 

Then we were working on development, managed by Nick Zambrano. This phase wasn't the hardest but we had to make things quickly and therefore the code is not always really coherent. But everything is functionnal. Again, one week for development, testing and documentation was too short. We managed to deliver everything on time and I'm proud of what we did because we went out of our confort zone. We managed to organize ourselves in spite of the other projects we had to handle.

## Conclusion

Overall, I think I learnt new software engineering principles. We did things that we never did before in this project. As a student from Peip, I was not used to using jUnit and making sequence diagrams. Although we had so little time for all phases except the use-case phase, we managed to deliver everything on time and I'm proud of what we did during this whole project. But I still could have done better.
