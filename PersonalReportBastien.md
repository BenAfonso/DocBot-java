## Project :

In general, I am rather satisfied by the project. The fact of being able to choose its own subject allowed us to involve us more in the project.

During this project, I was the general manager of the project and I was also in charge of the domain analysis andÂ  the database. I knew how to get involved to supply the best possible work during the phases and I knew how to separate the work between the people so that the project moves forward as quickly as possible

## Organisation :

During the progress of the project, we knew how to divide the work within our team to supply so a quality work.

Thanks to our organization we were able to return the work in time even if deadlines were sometimes surrealist. For example, I do not understand how we can realize the whole development of an application in one week.

I think that there was a problem of general organization of the project. I think that if we would have been able to manage completely the organization of the project, we would not have set for example 5 weeks on use cases and 1 week for the development as the constraints of the project stipulated. We would so have louse to supply an application of a better quality.
