**This is an objective report about the design phase.**

The design phase was the phase where we messed up the most at the moment.

First of all, we were struggling for making diagrams using Draw.io and as the responsible for the tools, I found a bit frustrating having to create this big amount of diagrams for just the four of us. I decided to find an other way of modeling the diagrams, that would help us generating code from the work we were doing on this phase. Then I decided to present StarUML to the team. I took the long task of rewriting all diagrams we had on paper, pictures and draw.io to StarUML. I created all the fa√ßades, classes, DAO so all the members of the group could start enjoying drag-n-dropping to make diagrams. This whole process made us late for the scheduled milestone.

We also had a hard time merging all the StarUML files. As I provided a base of all the classes, ... Then we all worked in isolation and when the time to merge all the diagrams came, we realised how repetitive and painful it was. And as it was nearly impossible to collaborate on this software, Bastien took the responsability of this.
 
But I don't think that it was all of our fault. As I mentionned during a meeting we had with the tutor, as the responsible for this phase, I would never agree for my team, making them work on the hardest part, the most time-consumming phase and the most important to understand. But it's still a school project and we must deliver things at the time we get asked to do it (+- 1 day). We tried to develop 4 diagrams with a better quality, here is the list: 
- Modify profile (Manage his profile)
- Accept / Reject an appointment
- Make an appointment
- Validate / Reject a doctor

We had three meetings where we all worked for 3 hours, working and helping each other. And I'm not considerating all the time we spent at home working on this.

We made mistakes. I'm pretty proud to see the way me managed to deal with these. We got told too late that we had to limit the work and focus on quality and with the last rush we had, we clearly focused on quantity over quality (time consumming) and we are aware of this. We also are aware that our diagrams could be much better. But overall we are proud of the work we did on this phase, it was the first time we focused on this type of diagrams on real projects and we learnt a lot.
