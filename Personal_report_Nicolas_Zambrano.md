## Introduction

​	We need to produce a java application. To do this we separate different the project in different phases. I was in charge of development, documentation and communication part.

​	We had the idea to develop an application for doctor and patient to help them to had an appointment.

## During the project

​	Many times we were in a hurry by the different deadline. In fact we had to much time to make the different uses cases and not enough time for the development part or the design part. So the application is not complete as we want to. 

​	I knew how to manage the development part and let my team knows what they have to do.

​	I learnt many things during this project like how to make a good design of an application and how to manage a team. Either I learnt in term of development, many things like how work a DAO and all other design pattern we used.



## Conclusion

​	We develop an entire application in a few time. Many time we get a lack of time, some part was incomplete but I learnt many things in this project. With more time for the design part or the development part we would produce a better application.
