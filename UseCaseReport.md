Use Case Report
(The one in charge: Yoann Masson)


About the management of the use cases analysis, each of us had to make 4 to 5 use cases. We tried to regroup the use case by actor.

<b>Time management:</b>
	First Week: Each one of the team member made theirs use cases

	Second Week: Meeting to clarify some part of the application, in order to clarify the use cases. We all verify each use case to make sure we had the same idea about how the application works, some clarifications were made.

	Third week: Meeting with the tutor, and at the end of the meeting the following things were brought up:
Use cases were too descriptive and should be more about what the system actually does
Uses cases were added about the management of comments, Benjamin Afonso made them in addition of his previous work.


The main directive was to follow the template given on moodle, we had no problem with this.
Making the use case really allowed us to think the application in details and depth, and having a better overview on the whole project.
