## Introduction

​	We need to produce a java application. To do this we separate different the project in different phases. I was in charge of use cases, unit tests and the oral presentation

## During the project

During the project, i find that the milestone were wrongly scheduled. At first we had 3 weeks to design use cases and only one week and a half of development.
And because of that we did not had the time to make the use case that we add in the end of the design phase because we had too few according to the tutor.
At first, I struggled with all the abstraction and facade concept but after developing the login controller, it was more clear. I think it was a good idea to have this intermediary phase where we had to make with the entire team the login process.



## Conclusion

​Overall it was nice to develop an application from scratch, and to apply all the concept we saw in class.
